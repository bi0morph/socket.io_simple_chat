##Here are some ideas to improve the application:

1. ~~Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects~~
2. ~~Add support for nicknames~~
3. ~~Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.~~
4. Add “{user} is typing” functionality
5. Show who’s online
6. Add private messaging
7. Share your improvements!
